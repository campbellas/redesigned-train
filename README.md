# redesigned-train
This is a simple journal program. It begins by prompting the user for whether they want to read, write, or exit. There are some gentle input validations utilized to mitigate crashes and undefined behavior; and as I learn more, I will add more robust checks. 

One area I am trying to improve is validation of input. I have found some interesting ways to provide some checks, but it still feels incomplete. I'd love some input on how I can do better with it.

This is the first time writing a readme, so if I did it wrong tell me. `
